# Python/Psycopg2 analysis

(A)
The code is computing and printing the mark for each of the courses in each of the terms for the students. At the end it computes an average.


(B)
The exception that has not been considered is if the database was unable to connect properly.


(C)
Execute would run 10 + 1 = 11 times.


(D)
select c.code, c.title, c.uoc, e.mark, distinct c.term
from   Enrolments e join Courses c on c.id = e.course
where  term = %s and student = %s order by term

Essentially combining both the queries into 1 so that there would be less execute calls and thus being moer efficient.
